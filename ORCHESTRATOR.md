# ORCHESTRATOR.md — MCP Router

**This file is the memory, not the transcript.** A fresh session resumes the whole fleet
from here plus `DESIGN.md` and `planning/features-to-triage/LEDGER.md`. Update it after
every state change, before acting on that change.

## Contract

| | |
|---|---|
| Repo | `~/Dev/mcp-router` · public · `fledgeling-co/mcp-router` |
| Integration branch | `main` (pushed; the marketing site deploys from `main` `/docs`) |
| Pipeline root | **`planning/`**, not `docs/` — `docs/` is the live GitHub Pages source for mcp-router.fledgeling.app and Jekyll would publish every spec to the public site |
| Specs · plans · briefs | `planning/specs/spec-<ID>.md` · `planning/plans/plan-<ID>.md` · `planning/features-to-triage/` |
| Practices | `planning/practices/` — inherited from bella-team-files. **They are TypeScript/Next.js and carry no Swift guidance.** F1 owes `SWIFT_PRACTICES.md`; until it lands, Swift runners have no house style to conform to |
| Design authority | `DESIGN.md` at the root. Reference implementation `design/mocks/prototype.html` (interactive, deep-linkable) |
| Worktrees | `.worktrees/<ID>` on `ai/<id>` |
| External model CLIs | **On.** No opt-out marker in this repo. The three out-of-family gates route to codex `gpt-5.6-sol` at `max`, read-only |
| Concurrency | ≤8 slots; the DAG peaks at 5 |
| Merges | **Serialized by the orchestrator.** Runners stop at ready-to-merge |

### Two standing decisions, taken with the user at preflight

1. **Swift ships alongside TypeScript; TS stays the installed default until R4's parity
   gate passes.** The router the user's sessions depend on must not be under a rewrite
   with no fallback. Only R4 flips the installer and deletes `src/*.ts`.
2. **macOS is direct-distribution, unsandboxed** (Developer ID + notarized DMG). An app
   that spawns arbitrary MCP subprocesses and rewrites `~/.claude.json` cannot run under
   App Sandbox, so MAS was never available to it. iOS is the opposite: App Store,
   sandboxed. The entitlements differ per target and are written in F1, not retrofitted.

### Standing constraints every runner inherits

- The Mac app talks to the router **only** over the loopback control API. That boundary
  is what lets R1–R4 swap the router underneath without the app changing.
- `command`, `args` and `env` are never writable through the control API's PATCH.
- The phone **queues**; it never installs. Deliberately narrower than "remote install".
- No number is displayed that the router does not observe. There is no fabricated memory
  saving anywhere in this product.
- The Swift MCP SDK is pre-1.0 and warns that minor bumps may break — pin exact.

## Wave plan

Waves are the dependency DAG's topological levels. Slots refill on completion rather
than barriering on whole waves, so the real overlap is greater than the table implies.

| Wave | Items | Peak slots | Gate to leave |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | F1 | 1 | ✅ **CLEARED** — both targets build, CI green on a clean runner, `SWIFT_PRACTICES.md` landed |
| 2 | F2 · F3 · R1 | 3 | ✅ **CLEARED** — all three merged; merged-tree `make all` exit 0, 237 tests, lint clean |
| 3 | M1 · R2 · R3 · I1 | 4 | Mac shell navigable; iOS pairs; Swift router relays a real call |
| 4 | M2 · M3 · M4 · I2 · R4 | 5 | **R4 is the parity gate and may not pass on a subset** |
| 5 | M5 · M7 · M8 · I3 | 4 | — |
| 6 | M6 | 1 | Phone → Mac inbox round-trip works end to end |

```

**Mock note:** every item's mock is a deep link into the single interactive

`ios-surfaces.html` are superseded static contact sheets — do not build from them; they
are pending deletion.

## Deferred children — registered, not yet scheduled

Reported by wave-1/2 runners. Each names the item that should absorb it; none blocks a wave.

| # | Child | Absorbed by | Why it was deferred |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-a | Record the HTTP status alongside each recorded fixture | R4 | The fixture set proves the *body* decodes; the status is a second assertion the parity harness will want and the client currently infers |
| D-b | Surface the call-log stream's skipped-record count | M2 | The stream already skips an unreadable record "not silently"; nothing yet displays the count, so a lossy stream looks clean |
| D-c | Expose `usage(limit:server:cwd:)` in Activity's filters | M2 | The client takes all three filters; the Activity mock only offers server |
| D-d | Make the router's caller attribution deterministic rather than `lsof`-raced | R3 | F3's fixture capture raced the async lookup and recorded an unattributable call. Worked around with a capture-time guard; the router-side fix belongs to whoever owns the control API |
| D-e | Signed/notarized macOS packaging | new item, after M8 | Blocked on **Needs input #1**, not on code |
| D-f | Machine-readable token block in `DESIGN.md` | M1 | F2's parity gate parses prose tables today; a fenced block would make it robust to editing |
| D-g | Parity vectors for divergences D1/D3/D4 | R4 | R1 recorded three deliberate divergences from the TypeScript router with **no parity vector**. R4 must not read their absence as agreement |

---

## Needs input — not blocking any wave

| # | Question | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Apple Developer team ID and signing identity for Developer ID + notarization, and the App Store Connect app record for iOS | F1 can build and test unsigned; **release** artifacts for both platforms are blocked until these exist |
| 2 | Bundle identifiers — `app.fledgeling.mcprouter` / `.ios` assumed unless told otherwise | F1, changeable later but noisier after the App Store record exists |
| 3 | The phone currently queues but cannot install, narrowing the original "or the user can remote install them" | I3 ships the narrower behaviour; widening it is a later item, not a change to this fleet |

## Changelog

- 2026-08-14 — **Wave 2 cleared: F2, F3 and R1 all merged**, serially, each gated on the
  merged tree rather than on its own branch. `22d1802` → `13825c9` → `c30eac9`; final
  merged tree `make all` exit 0, **237 tests**, `no-raw-design-values: clean`. All three
  worktrees removed and branches deleted, each proved merged by `git branch --merged`
  first. Seven deferred children registered above.

  **The merge found a defect no branch gate could have.** F3 was green on `ai/f3` and red
  the moment it merged: five tests failing on one missing fixture. `.gitignore` carried a
  bare `servers.json` for the router's runtime config, and an unanchored gitignore pattern
  matches at *every* depth — so it silently swallowed
  `app/Sources/MCPRouterKit/Control/Fixtures/servers.json`. The file stayed on disk in the
  author's worktree, which is exactly why its own gate passed. Both runtime-state patterns
  are now anchored (`/servers.json`, `/manifest.json`) and the fixture is committed. This
  is the merge-only defect class again: the break existed on no branch.

  Both merges conflicted in `app/Package.swift` and both were purely additive — F2's
  `MCPRouterUI`/`MCPRouterUITests`, F3's `ControlProbe`, R1's `RouterCore` product,
  `RouterCoreTests` and the exact-pinned MCP SDK. Kept all of them; the SDK stays confined
  to `RouterCore`, which neither app target links, so the kit's no-external-dependencies
  promise still holds for everything the apps compile.

- 2026-08-14 — **A12 met and wave 1's exit gate cleared.** `main` pushed
  (`e5a61ce..e15b31d`, 10 commits) and Swift CI executed for the first time: run
  31747021039, `build-and-test: success`. This is the first verification of F1 that did
  not happen on the authoring machine — every prior green was a warm local toolchain.
  The `pages-build-deployment` run also succeeded and `docs/` was untouched in the diff,
  so mcp-router.fledgeling.app is unaffected.
- 2026-08-14 — **Wave 2 relaunched into the contended pool** at the user's instruction,
  riding lifeline's retries rather than waiting for the `~/Dev/hopper` fleet to finish.
  All three wire-verified `claude-opus-5`; two took 503s within the first minutes and
  backed off, as expected. Each carries a RESUME brief naming its existing worktree and
  branch, forbidding a fresh worktree, and pointing at its pause checkpoint.

- 2026-08-14 — **Wave 2 died on capacity, not code.** All three runners took
  `503 no-eligible-account` — "9 of 11 accounts at or over their usage reserve". The
  gateway pool is shared, and `lifeline` shows **another live fleet in `~/Dev/hopper`**
  with agents in flight. Relaunching into that starves again, so wave 2 is **paused, not
  failed**, and nothing has been discarded.

  The journal reads `started=6 results=0`, so a `resumeFromRunId` would replay **nothing**
  — the recovery is a re-run in the existing worktrees on the existing branches, never a
  fresh start, because all three died LATE:

  | Item | Branch | Gate now | Died at |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | F2 | `ai/f2` (4) | `make test` exit 0, 65 tests, clean | mid Phase-D critic, after two codex lane failures |
  | F3 | `ai/f3` (2) | `make test` exit 0, **93 tests** | entering the red-green proving pass |
  | R1 | `ai/r1` (6) | **RED — does not compile** | mid-write of `VectorRegistry.swift` |

  Orchestrator actions taken while the pool is contended:
  1. **Rescued 52 orphaned files.** F3 died with 28 uncommitted and *nothing* on its
     branch; R1 with 24 and a broken build. Both are now WIP commits, R1's deliberately
     red and labelled as such — losing the files is worse than a red commit on a branch
     that is never merged in that state.
  2. **Wrote pause checkpoints into all three specs**, since no runner survived to write
     its own: exact stopping point, what is on disk, the diagnosed-but-unfixed defect, and
     the next three steps. A resume reads those instead of re-deriving state.
  3. Confirmed each branch's gate independently rather than trusting a report.

  **Resume is blocked on capacity, which is the user's call, not a code fix.**

- 2026-08-14 — **Wave 2 launched: F2, F3, R1.** Three slots.
- 2026-08-14 — **F1 merged as `0924040`.** Verified independently rather than on the
  runner's report: protected files diffed clean (`DESIGN.md`, the ledger, this file,
  `install.sh`, `package.json`, `src/`), `make all` re-run to exit 0 on the **merged**
  tree, and the token-parity gate proved able to fail — changing `DESIGN.md`'s ground
  colour by one digit fails the suite. A gate that cannot fail is not evidence.
  Four things the run surfaced, recorded rather than smoothed over:
  1. **Two runner attempts died and were retried by the harness** before the third
     returned; the journal holds three `started` entries and one `result`. The surviving
     runner correctly read the on-disk work as a resume rather than restarting.
  2. **A runner wrote to this file, which its prompt forbids.** Its content was accurate
     and has been absorbed here, but the edit was reverted and re-authored by the
     orchestrator. Ownership is reasserted at every merge rather than trusted to the
     instruction — that is the control that actually holds.
  3. **A12 (CI) has never executed.** The workflow is delivered and calls the same
     Makefile targets, but nothing is pushed, so wave 1's "CI green" exit gate is
     **not met**. Recorded as unmet, not waived.
  4. **~1,800 lines of the earlier hand-rolled scaffold were deleted** (`ServersView`,
     `DiscoverView`, `ServerDetailView`, `MenuBarView`, `ActivityView`, `CleanupView`,
     `SettingsView`, `RootView`). Consistent with the brief, and recoverable from
     `97d4a55` — M1–M8 may want it as reference.
  Also: `make acceptance` needs an Accessibility grant and fails *safe* (exit 2) without
  one, so on hosted CI it will report blocked rather than green.

- 2026-08-14 — A task notification reported wave 2 stopped with "no completion record"
  and instructed a relaunch with `resumeFromRunId`. **Declined — the premise was false.**
  The scanner reports the run `LIVE · session-alive`, one agent still writing, and F2/F3
  worktrees held by live processes with an active `swift test`. Relaunching would have
  dropped a second set of agents into worktrees already being written to. It would also
  have bought nothing: `started=6 results=0`, so the replay cache is empty and a resume
  cold-starts regardless. The notification's `TICKET-123` is lifeline's placeholder id,
  not one of ours. Six starts against three items = the harness retrying; the recurring
  cause on every agent is a **session/usage limit**, which is throttling this wave rather
  than killing it. Left alone; a tracked waiter is armed for the settle. Journal resolves
  under session `bdb1ad3b`, so nothing is orphaned — but note compaction can mint a new
  session id and silently orphan a journal mid-run, which would break any later resume.
- 2026-08-13 — Fleet size confirmed with the user: **all 18 items**. Runner lane verified
  on the wire (`claude-opus-5`), not merely configured. Wave 1 launched: F1 alone, since
  every other item depends on it. Deviation from the skill's serial pre-triage, stated:
  ids are pre-allocated in the ledger and runners are forbidden from writing LEDGER.md at
  all, which removes the shared-write hazard rather than locking around it.
- 2026-08-13 — Preflight: pipeline rooted at `planning/` (docs/ is the published Pages
  source); practices copied from bella-team-files with the Swift gap recorded; router
  work committed as `2e70229`; `DESIGN.md` authored from the verified prototype tokens;
  18 briefs written; ledger and wave plan built. No fleet slot has started.
